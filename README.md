# I'm currently working to understand:
1. Mathematical formulation of the model
2. Detailed mathematical derivations underlying the VAE objective
3. Derivation of the overall architecture from first principles
4. Structural/architectural analysis and design rationale
5. Role and computation of the KL-Divergence term


### I am referring to the papers
1. [“An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02691)
1. [“Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114)


### **Next Step**

I will fully implement the paper’s complete model from the ground up.

---

## **Completed**

* Designed the architecture from first principles
* Implemented the full architecture from scratch
* Trained the model end-to-end
* Performed optimization and tuning
* Documented thorough mathematical derivations and notes in my notebook

---

## **Pending**

* Build the full training pipeline
* Build the inference pipeline
* Implement the reconstruction workflow
* Implement the image generation workflow
