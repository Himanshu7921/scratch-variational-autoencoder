# I'm currently working to understand:
1. Mathematical formulation of the model
2. Detailed mathematical derivations underlying the VAE objective
3. Derivation of the overall architecture from first principles
4. Structural/architectural analysis and design rationale
5. Role and computation of the KL-Divergence term


### I am referring to the paper [“Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114)
